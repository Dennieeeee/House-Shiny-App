# House-Shiny-App
This project is to create a R Shiny Dashboard, which contains both ui.R and server.R files. The purpose is to present the key information for 
people who want to buy an used house. I will set up the business questions for intended audiences and then build several visualizations.

The business questions are:
- How did the lot size of houses change throughout years?
- What's the relationship between lot size of houses and sales price in different neighberhoods?
- How many houses were built each year and how many houses got remodeled each year?
