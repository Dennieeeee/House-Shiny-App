                 we gained a better understanding of how many houses were built each year, how the price change over time, and so on. 
                 There are a lot of properties located nearby NAmes, North Ames, but they are also expensive. 
                 Also, more houses were built and got remodeled after 2000. As the price increase, the basement area and garage 
                 area are also getting bigger. Generally, houses that were built around 2010 are expensive. 
                 However, customers can consider the houses that are on low interest rate. 
                 In addition, the partial houses are the ones that were not completed when last assessed. 
                 Customers can choose between normal sale, family sale, abnormal sale, and allocation sale because they are cheaper 
                 than the partial houses. Overall, this dashboard provided a lot of information to support customersâ€™ decision making.
